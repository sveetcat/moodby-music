# Tired of Legal Risks with Spotify in Your Business?
## Switch to Moodby — Royalty-Free Music Made for Commercial Spaces

Running a café, a boutique, or a beauty salon?  
Then you already know: music isn’t just background noise — it sets the tone, drives customer behavior, and keeps people coming back.

But if you’re using **Spotify**, **Apple Music**, or **YouTube** in your space — you might be breaking the law.

## ❌ The Problem with Mainstream Streaming Services

Most popular music streaming apps (yes, even Spotify Premium) are **for personal use only**.

That means:

- ❌ Playing them in a commercial setting = **copyright infringement**  
- ❌ You could face fines of **€2,000–€30,000**  
- ❌ Licensing is confusing, fragmented, and expensive  

Even Spotify Business (offered via third-party partners) doesn’t eliminate the need for performance rights licenses.  
And it's **not even available in most countries**.
